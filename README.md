# Emulate_sm
This is a demonstration showing you that how to Emulate instagram and with this demo I cannot assure you stealthyness but sometimes this will work. 
Here, i took instagram for this demo. 


#Step:1
After hacking the instagram or after knowing the user credentials. 
- Open your preffered browser, then head over to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com).
- On the login page go to developer options and press Ctrl + Shift + M or press on the toggle device emulation.&nbsp;

- In that, in default IPhone's or Samsung's phones are used So if you know your victims mobile phone information like screen resolution, user string you can do this step easily.

- If your victim's device is in this list go ahead and proceed login, or else we need to add your custom device. 
- So, in order to do that click on <code>Edit..</code>
- In the emulated devices, click on <code>Add a Custom device</code>

- To know about victim's user string, Head over to this website [Grabify](https://grabify.link/).
- Here's a quick tutorial about **Grabify** [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lru-UWQ06I0&feature=share&si=ELPmzJkDCLju2KnD5oyZMQ).
- Copy the user string in the Grabify and paste it here and for screen resolution a quick google search will help you. 
- Then add device, and go to back then select this custom device. The go head and try login in to instagram. 

# What this actually do ? 

- Generally, what happens when you log into Instagram on a new device, Instagram will automatically inform the victim there is a login eg. like below

- So, by emulating the victim's device, instagram will send a :warning: alert to the victim like there is a login in this device but the real catch over here is the device we are using, has the same specs as the victim. 
- So, there is a chance the victim can ignore this message. 
- You can ask, but instagram also send the location of the login, but this location was never accurate. 
-  Also, So you're gonna use instagram like that in the victim's device ratio, No idon't!!
-  By simply exiting the responsive page to normal web page or a reload, with that we can use their Instagram. 
-  But still victim will get that Instagram is using in the same phone, even it is using in the Desktop browser.
